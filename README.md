Learning React with this project

1. npm create vite@latest
2. Go to its folder then do npm install
3. {Optional} npm run dev => to test if it's working
4. Go to src folder, delete assets, App.css, index.css
5. In the files remaining, delete the import statements for the deleted files
6. Componenets name should start with a capital letter, don't forget to export them.
7. You can only render a single component. So if you want to render multiple components together, wrap them in the div tag. These div tags here are called fragments. Since this was a common problem, hence you can also use <>...</> to wrap the components.
